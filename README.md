# Coursera Machine Learning Matlab Code

## Introduction

These files are from Andrew Ng's Coursera Machine Learning course, I originally took the course in June 2014. The course has since been converted into an on-demand version, which you can find on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/).

## Format 

Each week focusses on a different Machine Learning algorithm. The contents are shown below for exercises 1 - 8:

* Exercise 1 : Linear regression
* Exercise 2 : Logistic regression
* Exercise 3 : Multi-class classification and neural networks (pre-trained)
* Exercise 4 : Neural networks
* Exercise 5 : Regularized linear regression and overfitting (bias vs variance)
* Exercise 6 : Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
* Exercise 7 : K-Means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Exercise 8 : Anomaly detection and recomender systems
