# Coursera Machine Learning Matlab Code

## Introduction

These files are from Andrew Ng's Coursera Machine Learning course, I originally took the course in June 2014. The course has since been converted into an on-demand version, which you can find on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/).

## Format 

Each week focusses on a different Machine Learning algorithm. The contents are shown below for exercises 1 - 8:

* Exercise 1 : Linear regression
* Exercise 2 : Logistic regression
* Exercise 3 : Multi-class classification and neural networks (pre-trained)
* Exercise 4 : Neural networks
* Exercise 5 : Regularized linear regression and overfitting (bias vs variance)
* Exercise 6 : Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
* Exercise 7 : K-Means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Exercise 8 : Anomaly detection and recomender systems

## Getting Started

To run any of the homework exercises, cd into the relevant subdirectory and open the exn.m file (where n is 1 - 8). For example week 3 would be ex3.m. Then run the script which will pop up plots and print info on the console.

## Course Review

My background is that I have a Master's in Electrical and Information Sciences Tripos from the University of Cambridge. This involved a lot of control system theory, linear algebra, and some convex optimisation. But as this was all over a decade ago now, I was apprehensive about the learning curve for this course.

I needn't have worried. The course instructor, Andrew Ng, has a knack for explaining things very clearly with worked examples so you can see how the theory applies in practice. There are introductory lectures on [Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave)  (the open-source version of Matlab) if you haven't used this tool before. 

The topics covered include a range of supervised and unsupervised algorithms, which run in Matlab and give a good understanding of the theory. The discussion forums were invaluable for the programming assignments, there were a few times when I was really stumped and some extra clarification on there helped me out. In general people were very helpful, so don't hesitate to start a new discussion if you're stuck - there are likely many others with the same issue !

To summarise, I would say this is one of the best online courses I've taken to date. Take a look at the [Coursetalk](https://www.coursetalk.com/providers/coursera/courses/machine-learning) review site to see other peoples' reviews also. If you're interested in the expanding field of Machine Learning I highly recommend this course.
